Adding Azure Data Factory (ADF) parameters to a database can provide several benefits:

Dynamic Configuration: Parameters allow for dynamic configuration of pipelines, making it easier to manage and modify data flows without hardcoding values.

Reusability: Parameters enable the reuse of pipeline components across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) by simply changing parameter values.

Maintainability: With parameters, you can centralize configuration settings, making it easier to maintain and update the pipeline as requirements change.

Scalability: Parameters help in scaling the data integration process by allowing the same pipeline to handle different datasets or database connections.

Security: Sensitive information such as connection strings or credentials can be parameterized and securely managed using Azure Key Vault, reducing the risk of exposing sensitive data.

Flexibility: Parameters provide flexibility in handling different scenarios and conditions within the pipeline, enabling more complex and adaptable data workflows.

Simplified Debugging: Parameters make it easier to test and debug pipelines by allowing you to quickly change input values and observe the effects.

Overall, using ADF parameters enhances the efficiency, flexibility, and manageability of data integration processes in Azure Data Factory.
