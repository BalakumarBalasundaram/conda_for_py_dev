## Introduction

This document outlines the structure of the Unity Catalog and provides guidelines for managing assets, projects, and users within the catalog.

## Catalog Structure

The Unity Catalog is organized into the following sections:

1. **Assets**: Contains all the assets uploaded to the catalog.
2. **Projects**: Contains all the projects created in the catalog.
3. **Users**: Contains all the users who have access to the catalog.

Each section is further divided into categories and subcategories to help organize and manage the content effectively.

## Asset Management

Assets are the building blocks of Unity projects. They include 3D models, textures, animations, scripts, and other resources that are used to create interactive experiences. The Unity Catalog provides tools for managing assets, including:

1. **Upload**: Users can upload assets to the catalog from their local machine or cloud storage.
2. **Search**: Users can search for assets by name, category, or tag.
3. **Edit**: Users can edit asset metadata, such as name, description, and tags.
4. **Delete**: Users can delete assets from the catalog.

## Project Management

Projects are collections of assets that are used to create Unity applications. The Unity Catalog provides tools for managing projects, including:

1. **Create**: Users can create new projects in the catalog.
2. **Edit**: Users can edit project metadata, such as name, description, and tags.
3. **Delete**: Users can delete projects from the catalog.
4. **Collaborate**: Users can invite other users to collaborate on projects.

## User Management

Users are individuals who have access to the Unity Catalog. The Unity Catalog provides tools for managing users, including:

1. **Invite**: Administrators can invite users to join the catalog.
